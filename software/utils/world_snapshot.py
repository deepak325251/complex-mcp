"""Seedless world snapshots.

Freeze a session's *generated* world so it can be loaded verbatim at login
instead of being rolled from a seed (ETOM-style: the world is read, not rolled).

Why pickle rather than hand-written JSON per app: a session's world is an
arbitrary object graph — typed dataclasses, nested lists/dicts, a `random.Random`
that is *shared* by reference with helpers like `TimeMachine`. Pickle preserves
that graph, including the shared-rng identity and the exact post-generation rng
state, so runtime id/timestamp/network minting reproduces the old seeded sequence
byte-for-byte. One utility works for all ~140 apps; no per-app serializer.

Recipe per app:
  1. BEFORE making the session seedless, run a bake against the still-seed-based
     code:  bake_session(core_session_at_seed_42, path)
     (bake while the core class is imported under its normal module name, so the
     pickle's class reference matches the one that exists at load time).
  2. Make the core session's __init__ seedless:
        restore_into(self, path); self.os = <live connector>
     (restore_into copies the frozen attributes onto `self`; pickle never calls
     __init__, so a changed/seedless class body is fine.)
